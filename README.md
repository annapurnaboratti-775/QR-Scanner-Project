# QR Code Scanner Project (Beginner-Friendly)

Welcome to my repository!  
This contains my **very first project using Python and OpenCV**.  
I am not an expert yet — but I am **eager to learn, build, and improve** my coding skills every day.

## 📁 Project Included in This Repository

### 🔹 QR Code Scanner (Python + OpenCV)
A simple but exciting project where I learned how to:

- Load images using OpenCV  
- Detect QR codes  
- Decode the embedded text  
- Draw a bounding box over the detected QR code  
- Save and display the output  

👉 **All project files are inside this folder:**  
### ➤ [QR_Project](./QR_Project)

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to explore:

- How computer vision works  
- How Python interacts with images  
- How QR codes can be detected and decoded  

This project helped me take my **first real step into OpenCV** and image processing.
